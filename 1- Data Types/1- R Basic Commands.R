### Assignments
x = 1
y <- 3 
  #Both '=' and '<-' are same
z = "Hello World"
z = 'Hello World'
  # Remember: R is case sensitive. 'z' is different than 'Z'

# We cannot add non-numeric variable with numberic variable
str = 'hello'
num = 5
num + str # output: Error in num + str : non-numeric argument to binary operator



### Calling Functions
print("Hello World")


### Calculations
1 + 2 
x + 5
y = x + 5
x = sqrt(16)
