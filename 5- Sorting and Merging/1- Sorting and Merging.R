### Merging
# Joining or Merging consists in combining 2 or more datasets' rows based on a 
# a common column/field between them 

# For a join to happen, 2 datasets need at least one same column. It matches rows that have
# that have identical values in this column.

# There are 4 types of Joins: Left Join, Full Outer Join, Inner Join, Right Join


# Left Join
temp = merge(Countries, Countries_Map, by = "Country.Code", all.x = TRUE)

# Correct Inner Join
Countries_All = merge(Countries, Countries_Map, by = "Country.Code")

# Full Outer Join
temp2 = merge(Countries_All, Countries_Info, by = "Country.Code", all = TRUE)

# Correct Left Join 
Countries_All = merge(Countries_All, Countries_Info, by = "Country.Code", all.x = TRUE)

## Remove unwanted object from global environment 
rm(temp,temp2)
