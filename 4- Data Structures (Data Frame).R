### Data Frame
# It has the ability to store different basic types of data
# The only thing that will be common is there length

my_vector = c(3,7,11,13) # Creating Vector 
my_str_vector = c("Hello", "World", "From", "R") # Creating Vector


my_data_frame = data.frame(my_vector, my_str_vector) 
# Variables are the two vector and the components in each vector is called as observation
